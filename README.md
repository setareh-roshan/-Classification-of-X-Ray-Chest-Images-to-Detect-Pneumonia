# -Classification-of-X-Ray-Chest-Images-to-Detect-Pneumonia
Recent deep learning methods provide an effective way to construct an end-to-end model that can compute final classification labels with the raw pixels of medical images. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep learning neural networks. CNNs represent a huge breakthrough in image recognition. In this article, we used CNN in order to recognizing Pneumonia infection from Xray images, also we extracted features from CNN and tried to increase accuracy by pattern recognition methods. We reached to 80% accuracy on test data
